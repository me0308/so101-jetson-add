# so101-jetson

Hardware station for the SO-101 arm pair on a Jetson (or any Linux box). The
Jetson owns the servo bus and the cameras; other machines reach the arm through
it, so nobody else has to set hardware up from scratch.

it, so nobody else has to set hardware up from scratch.

> **Fork note.** This fork records the P3 bring-up on a different pair of machines
> than the original: the simulator runs on **Windows + Isaac Sim 6.0.1**, not Spark.
> Two things are added here — a dof-limits fix in `sim/isaac_adapter.py` for
> Isaac 6.0.1, and `sim/so101_gui_bridge.py`, which runs the receiver inside the
> Isaac Sim GUI when the standalone `python.bat` window renders a black viewport.
> Setup and measurements: [docs/P3_SETUP_CARLIN.md](docs/P3_SETUP_CARLIN.md).

The pluggable `env.type = real` adapter that feeds the detector / retriever /

The pluggable `env.type = real` adapter that feeds the detector / retriever /
repair pipeline lives in the MAIN repo (`vla-self-repair`) and pins a commit of
this one. Keep the boundary: **drivers here, the pipeline seam there.**

## Two layers -- and why

| layer | program | owns hardware | network |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 · local, direct** | `programs/p1_follow_leader.py` — the arm alone | itself | none |
| | `programs/p2_record_cameras.py` — arm **and** cameras at once, uncoupled | itself | none |
| | `programs/p4_collect_real.py` — real teleop + multi-cam dataset ⬜ | itself | none |
| **1 · gateway** | `programs/p3_teleop_sim.py` — real leader drives Isaac's virtual SO-101 | leader only | Jetson→Spark, UDP |
| | `net/so101_host.py` — resident service ⬜ | **exclusive** | ZMQ |
| | `programs/p5_vla_control.py` — VLA on Spark drives the real arm ⬜ | via host | both ways |

p3 sits in layer 1 but deliberately does **not** go through the gateway: it
drives a *simulated* follower, so it needs the leader and nothing else. That
keeps it usable before the gateway exists, and keeps the real follower out of
the picture entirely.

★ **Layer 0 must never go through the network.** Programs 1 and 2 exist to
validate hardware; put a transport under them and a failure can no longer be
attributed to the arm rather than the link.

Each layer-0 program answers a different question, and the difference is the
point:

| | asks |
|---|---|
| **p1** | does the arm work? |
| **p2** | does running the arm and the cameras together degrade either of them? |
| **p2 `--no-arm`** | do the cameras work? — reach for this when a camera misbehaves: no arm, no threads of ours, nothing else to blame |
| **p4** ⬜ | collect a dataset: episodes, one shared timeline, a gap spoils the episode |

p2 runs the arm loop and every camera in their own threads, sharing nothing and
unable to stop each other. It records two INDEPENDENT streams and reports on
each; it does not join them onto one timeline and it does not throw anything
away, because there is no episode here to spoil — that is p4's job. What p2
measures is whether the isolation actually holds: its arm-loop rate and
per-step timing are logged exactly as p1 logs them, so the two runs compare
directly. Verified against fake devices — with a camera dropping out, and with
the arm faulting, the other stream's rate did not move.

★ **Only one thing may own the servo bus at a time.** When the host is running,
the layer-0 programs cannot open the port — and must say so in those words.

## Quick start
See **[docs/SOP.md](docs/SOP.md)**.

```
bash setup/install.sh && newgrp dialout
cp setup/devices.example.env devices.env    # fill from: python tools/list_devices.py
source devices.env
~/so101venv/bin/python programs/p1_follow_leader.py
```

## Tests (no hardware)
```
python tools/selftest.py        # 23 unit checks, no OpenCV / lerobot / arm
python tools/loopback_test.py   # the whole p3 bridge against itself, real UDP
python tools/loopback_test.py --sim-fps 10     # ... with a simulator that lags
```

## Status
| | |
|---|---|
| p1 | **run on hardware 2026-09-09.** 30/60/120 Hz; loop 2.7 ms; follow latency ~105 ms at 120 Hz, and it does not improve with loop rate — it is the servo, not our sampling |
| p2 | rewritten as arm + cameras in isolated threads. Threading verified against fake devices; **not yet run on hardware** |
| p3 | (Jetson + Windows RTX 4090, Isaac Sim 6.0.1). Leader map fitted and visually verified; 20 Hz, 1644/1644 acked, 0 lost, 0 superseded, sim-follow latency 33.8 ms (r ≥ 0.99). See [docs/P3_SETUP_CARLIN.md](docs/P3_SETUP_CARLIN.md). |
| `sim/isaac_adapter.py` | written, **never run** — needs Spark's Isaac version |
| p4, p5, gateway | not started |
